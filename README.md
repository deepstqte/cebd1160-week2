### Docs section 2

Now comes a real description of what this repo is about!!

This repository is for a homework *excercise* related to `git`, In class we learned how to do basic `git`, you know stuff like the following:

```bash
# Create file
echo "This is a line" > file.txt

# stage the file in git
git add file.txt

# commit the changes
git commit -m "First commit"
```
